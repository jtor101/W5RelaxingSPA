# W5RelaxingSPA

Functionality:
This project is a single page application that displays information about the services that a fictional spa provides. The project is set up to retrieve service information from the category and service that the user selects when the server is running.

Server Information:
The server draws from the server.js file contained in the root, and can be started by opening a command prompt, changing your directory to the directory you downloaded the repo to, and entering "node server.js" into the command prompt.

Goals:
With the theme being a spa, my primary focus was trying to be more ambitious with color setting after functionality was ensured. Spa's seem to inspire a cool color theme, a lot of purples, greens, and blues. So I wanted to try a warmer color scheme of reds, oranges, and darker yellows. The results bring about visions of a sunset/night spa in my opinion. This was a sub-goal within the primary color setting goal, I wanted the theme to give visions of an ambience for a spa that doesn't actually exist.
